This dictionary was originally compiled from public domain sources
for the amSpell spell-checker by

  Erik Frambach (e-mail: e.h.m.frambach@eco.rug.nl).


I have further modified this dictionary for use with WinEdt:
  The dictionary is decompressed, translated from OEM to Windows
  Character set, and sorted by WinEdt's Dictionary Manager.
